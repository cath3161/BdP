 <h1>About us <p><br> Welcome to the homepage of Pfadfinderstamm Nydam from Kiel.<br> We don't know the word ¨bored¨ with the scouts, there is always somthing going on. <br> Our groups go around in the nature, engage themselves, thinker, play musik or do theater. <br> What kind of activities that we do are impulsiv,but still the themes and social role are playing an important role. <br> The idea for scouting came from Robert Baden-Powell, and we still live by his idea. for us that means, <br> getting to know everthing and everyone, where ever we go. <br> Doing what we have to for the community, group and city. <br> Know the interest of all members and try them out. <br> Make friendship across countries, religion or origin. <br>
 Not talk about political or religions themes to be open to everyone. <br>¨Leave the world better behind, than how we found it¨<br> We are happy to welcome new ¨Wolflings¨form the age of 7. <br> New scouts from the age of 12 and new rangers from age of 16. <br> Who want to help and support our wark.</p></h1>
 <h1>Life as a scout <p><br> To live as a scouts meanes: Living in a group, learning togrther and making memories togrther. <br>Group doesn't mean: everyone is euqual. Everyone brings there own possibilities and knoleadge. <br>But no matter how diffrent scouts can be in a group, they all fell conneted. <br>
To be a scout is an offer for all ages. To stimulate all ages, there are diffrent groups, with diffrent activities. <br>Tere are three diffrent groups, ¨Wolflings¨, scouts and rangers and rover. <br> The international recognition sign. All scouts wear the scarf proudly and thereby show <br> the whole world taht they belong to the biggest youth movement in the world. <br>
Try out new things, dicover new things. Make a wager: We want to show kids and young people taht adventures belong to everyday life. <br>That you can't do everything at once, but that you can learn a lot. <br> We give the scouts time and space to figure out there own strengths. <br>
The big adventure lures: The scouts are happy to go to the diffrent camps and they swim in the <br>memories from prior years of acamp. <br> Being away from home and everyday life, gives the scouts the possibelity to restrict everything <br> to what fits in there backpack. <br>
To scout is being in nature and being conneted to the nature. <br> From the beginning life in nature was a way for us to discover the essenitial.</p></h1>
 <h1>Scout ranks <p><br>The pack: The Wolflings meet in the pack. young scouts from the ages 6/7 to 11. <br>There are games to play and small adventures in the nature with other members. <br> At (Ratsfelsen) the wolflings meet up with the wise leaderwolf Akela, from the junglebook and together they talk <br>about the grouphours and themes. All the wolflings have a say there. <br>
    <br>The clan: In one clan there are five to seven scout members, from the ages 11/12 to 15. <br> Together as a group they experiense exiting adventures and fun with their group. <br>
    While doing so, they learn to take resopnsibility for themselves and their group. <br> The planning, organizing and carrying out their own camps, tripes or other actions, <br> is part of the their homemade program. During that they learn responsibility, <br>get creative and can make their own decisions and stand by them. <br>
    A lot of properties and crafts, that can help them later on in life,is something they learn and grow to do. <br><br> The round: The ranger and rover (R/R) meet up in the round. It is young executives between <br> the ages 16 and 25, with responsibilityfor wolfling, scouts, administration jobs or just for fun, <br> because own actions with peers also belong to begin in (R/R). some of them take <br>jobs for the (Stammesführung oder Landesverband). <br><br>
    The adults: Also adults 25+ can have a place in the group. <br> Which fits the motto ¨youth leads youth¨, they can be in the backgrund and help the R/R and scouts with advice. <br> They know that own experience is worthsomething and they are not the fun keepers of the younger groups. <br> but their support and help by ¨do it yourself¨. <br> At the same time they give the young ones alot of space to make their own experience . <br> For the adults there are also (Altpfadfindergilden), adultactions of diffrent kinds <br> and the possibility to be at every (Stammesaktion).
